This toolkit allows developers to deploy pre-trained deep learning models
through a high-level C++ Inference Engine API integrated with application logic.

This open source version includes two components: namely [Model Optimizer] and
[Inference Engine], as well as CPU, GPU and heterogeneous plugins to accelerate
deep learning inferencing on Intel® CPUs and Intel® Processor Graphics.
It supports pre-trained models from the [Open Model Zoo], along with 100+ open
source and public models in popular formats such as Caffe\*, TensorFlow\*,
MXNet\* and ONNX\*.

## Repository components:
* [Inference Engine]
* [Model Optimizer]
