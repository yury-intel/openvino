    - When installed as **root** the default installation directory for the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO is
    `/opt/intel/openvino_fpga_2019.<version>/`.<br>
        For simplicity, a symbolic link to the latest installation is also created: `/opt/intel/openvino/`.

8. A Complete screen indicates that the core components have been installed:
![](../img/install-linux-fpga-05.png)

The first core components are installed. Continue to the next section to install additional dependencies.

## <a name="install-external-dependencies"></a>Install External Software Dependencies

These dependencies are required for:

- Intel-optimized build of OpenCV library
- Deep Learning Inference Engine
- Deep Learning Model Optimizer tools

1. Change to the `install_dependencies` directory:
```sh
cd /opt/intel/openvino/install_dependencies   
```
2. Run a script to download and install the external software dependencies:
```sh
sudo -E ./install_openvino_dependencies.sh
```

The dependencies are installed. Continue to the next section to configure the Model Optimizer.

## <a name="configure-model-optimizer"></a>Configure the Model Optimizer

The Model Optimizer is a Python\*-based command line tool for importing
trained models from popular deep learning frameworks such as Caffe\*,
TensorFlow\*, Apache MXNet\*, ONNX\* and Kaldi\*.

The Model Optimizer is a key component of the Intel Distribution of
OpenVINO toolkit. You cannot perform inference on your trained model without
running the model through the Model Optimizer. When you run a
pre-trained model through the Model Optimizer, your output is an
Intermediate Representation (IR) of the network. The Intermediate
Representation is a pair of files that describe the whole model:

-   `.xml`: Describes the network topology
-   `.bin`: Contains the weights and biases binary data

For more information about the Model Optimizer, refer to the [Model Optimizer Developer Guide](../MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md). 

### Model Optimizer Configuration Steps

> **IMPORTANT**: The Internet access is required to execute the following steps successfully. If you have access to the Internet through the proxy server only, please make sure that it is configured in your environment.

You can choose to either configure all supported frameworks at once **OR** configure one framework at a time. Choose the option that best suits your needs. If you see error messages, make sure you installed all dependencies.

> **NOTE**: If you installed the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ to the non-default install directory, replace `/opt/intel` with the directory in which you installed the software.

**Option 1: Configure all supported frameworks at the same time**

1.  Go to the Model Optimizer prerequisites directory:
```sh
cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/install_prerequisites 
```
2.  Run the script to configure the Model Optimizer for Caffe,
    TensorFlow 1.x, MXNet, Kaldi\*, and ONNX:
```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites.sh
```

**Option 2: Configure each framework separately**

Configure individual frameworks separately **ONLY** if you did not select **Option 1** above.
1.  Go to the Model Optimizer prerequisites directory:
```sh
cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/install_prerequisites
```
2.  Run the script for your model framework. You can run more than one script:
-   For **Caffe**:

```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites_caffe.sh
```
-   For **TensorFlow 1.x**:
```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites_tf.sh
```
-   For **TensorFlow 2.x**:
```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites_tf2.sh
```
-   For **MXNet**:
```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites_mxnet.sh
```
-   For **ONNX**:
```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites_onnx.sh
```
-   For **Kaldi**:
```sh
sudo ./install_prerequisites_kaldi.sh
```
The Model Optimizer is configured for one or more frameworks.

You are ready to compile the samples by <a href="#run-the-demos">running the verification scripts</a>.

## <a name="run-the-demos"></a>Run the Verification Scripts to Verify Installation and Compile Samples

To verify the installation and compile two samples, run the verification applications provided with the product on the CPU:

1. Go to the **Inference Engine demo** directory:
```sh
cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/demo
```

2. Run the **Image Classification verification script**:
```sh
./demo_squeezenet_download_convert_run.sh
```
This verification script downloads a SqueezeNet model, uses the Model Optimizer to convert the model to the .bin and .xml Intermediate Representation (IR) files. The Inference Engine requires this model conversion so it can use the IR as input and achieve optimum performance on Intel hardware.<br>
This verification script builds the [Image Classification Sample Async](../../inference-engine/samples/classification_sample_async/README.md) application and run it with the `car.png` image in the demo directory. When the verification script completes, you will have the label and confidence for the top-10 categories:
![](../img/image_classification_script_output_lnx.png)

3. Run the **Inference Pipeline verification script**:
```sh
./demo_security_barrier_camera.sh
```
This verification script builds the [Security Barrier Camera Demo](@ref omz_demos_security_barrier_camera_demo_README) application included in the package. 

   This verification script uses the `car_1.bmp` image in the demo directory to show an inference pipeline using three of the pre-trained models. The verification script uses vehicle recognition in which vehicle attributes build on each other to narrow in on a specific attribute.

   First, an object is identified as a vehicle. This identification is used as input to the next model, which identifies specific vehicle attributes, including the license plate. Finally, the attributes identified as the license plate are used as input to the third model, which recognizes specific characters in the license plate.

  When the verification script completes, you will see an image that displays the resulting frame with detections rendered as bounding boxes, and text:
  ![](../img/security-barrier-results.png)

4. Close the image viewer window to complete the verification script.


To learn about the verification scripts, see the `README.txt` file in `/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/demo`.

For a description of the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO™ pre-trained object detection and object recognition models, see [Overview of OpenVINO™ Toolkit Pre-Trained Models](@ref omz_models_intel_index).

pip install numpy.py -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```
Use the `--trusted-host` parameter if the URL above is `http` instead of `https`.

* Modify or create `~/.pip/pip.conf` file to change the default download source with the content below:
```
[global]
index-url = http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
[install]
trusted-host = mirrors.aliyun.com
